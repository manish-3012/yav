            <h2>About Me 😇</h2>
            <p>I'm Yavanika Kaushal. <br>
            <br>
                I've always found a lover in Literature. Needless to say, however, pursuing it for my education and career with an embellishment of Marketing did wonders for me. I'm a writer, a poet, an artist, a trained classical singer, a concept art and culture study enthusiast, a prolific reader, travel adventurer, and a marketer, with endless possibilities.
                <br><br>
                I am currently working with a Marketing Communications Consultancy that believes in the power of its craft to drive social change. I am associated with - accounts driving social impact utilising the concept of impact sourcing for AI training in the development of agricultural structures and digitization of processes through computer vision and data annotation in the field of Healthcare. <br>
                I am also handling accounts for clients in the healthcare industry supporting the social cause of natural childbirth with medical and technology-based assistance; along with clients launching non medical cancer care for affected individuals and families.💕
