            <h1>Awakening: My Experience with Truth!</h1>
            <img class="code" src="/img/awake.jfif" alt="">
            <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>Shri Mataji is the
                Founder of Sahaja Yoga, a simple meditation technique that connects us to the
                Whole (The Universe). I had got my realization in Sahaj (effortlessly). The
                realization was quick and joy-giving, and so comforting (like a mother holding
                her baby with love and protection; I felt like the baby), I had been a
                13-14-year-old during the time of my realization. I experienced a gush of cool
                wind flowing through my fontanelle bone, and that was the beginning of my
                journey.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>In Sahaja yoga, we all
                are one big global family of brothers, sisters, uncles, and aunts; So traveling
                with this new family was a joy I had never before experienced. We had many
                small incidents throughout the trip with which our faith in our&nbsp;<span
                style='font-weight:bold'>Primordial Power</span>&nbsp;only increased. We
                reached the place and each Sahaja Yogi was in the&nbsp;<span style='font-weight:
                bold;font-style:italic'>present moment</span>, thoughtless and happy.</p>

                birthplace of H.H Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. I am blessed with Mother's love.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>For I may have wandered
                for a 1000 years before coming to this realization that we are a part of God's
                plan and it is not the other way round.</p>

                Devi and the Divine Vibrations - Shri Param Chaitanya around Mother (This
                picture is completely raw and untempered, hence the Truth)</p>

                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>While in Chhindwara, a
                particular experience cleared me to my core; It was evening time, and I was
                wandering along the path towards my shamiana and had lost my way. A glorious
                downpour had cut down our power supply and except for the main hall where the cultural
                programme was held, no other tent had electricity. I started running in between
                the rain, drenched and looking for my tent in the beautiful dark evening. I
                couldn't find anyone anywhere. I always loved getting drenched in the rain,
                this was different, the feeling was magnificent, every drop felt like it was
                soaking away the heat that my mind and body had accumulated in years.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>Even though I couldn't
                see the way to the hall I felt extremely secure, I removed my footwear and kept
                walking and musing at the moment whilst the muddy earth soft and calming
                beneath my feet cleared me. I was thoughtless and yet very aware;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>I don't know how I
                found my way to the hall, my sense of direction had become so clear all of a
                sudden; On reaching and entering the hall the rain stopped and I was the only
                person drenched from head to toe, I found everyone there, a huge
                festival,&nbsp;<span style='font-style:italic'>'Jalsa'</span>&nbsp;was
                awaiting. I was directed to my tent, I changed to dry clothing, and returned. I
                felt as if every cell in my being was rejoicing, thoughtlessly aware, and in
                the moment.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>This was also a time
                when&nbsp;<span style='font-weight:bold'>Shri Mataji</span>&nbsp;was in her
                Sakara Swaroop and I witnessed her presence. Now that Mother is in her Nirakaar
                Swaroop I witness her as the joy in and around me at all times. I am blessed to
                experience the joy-giving&nbsp;<span style='font-weight:bold'>Ritambhara Pragya</span>&nbsp;flowing
                through each living being. I am Blessed! I am Blessed! I am Blessed! ( Just
                recollecting and writing this is making me so happy!! :D)</p>

                bold;font-style:italic'>&quot;When you are in meditation you must allow
                yourself to be in thoughtless awareness. There, the Unconscious Itself, the
                Achetana itself will take charge of you. You will start moving with the force
                of Achetana.</span></p>

                take you there, where It wants you to go. You keep to thoughtless awareness all
                the time. Try to keep to thoughtless awareness as much as you can. When you are
                in thoughtless awareness you must know that you are in the Kingdom of God and
                His people, His arrangements, His consciousness, is going to look after

                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>As a kid, I was always
                inclined towards Divinity. I could never understand though why God never spoke
                to us when we prayed. As a 3-4-year-old, I'd think that the Gods depicted on
                television were real, everyone at our home watched these shows very keenly. It
                was only for me to learn later that there were actors playing characters of
                Gods.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>As I grew up I started
                reading about several epics and stories of God in Hindu literature; I had read
                the '<span style='font-weight:bold'>Bhagwat Geeta'</span>&nbsp;while still in
                school. I was from Loreto Convent, so reading and learning about the&nbsp;<span
                style='font-weight:bold'>Holy Bible</span>&nbsp;were easy.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>Despite coming from a
                strong Hindu family (Sanatan, as it's called), we've been quite liberal in
                learning and respecting all great religions. I learned about a majority of
                the&nbsp;<span style='font-weight:bold'>Sanatan Scriptures</span>, the&nbsp;<span
                style='font-weight:bold'>Holy</span>&nbsp;<span style='font-weight:bold'>Quran</span>,
                and its teachings from my grandparents and my father who were quite well-read
                in these areas. But that was not all, I liked reading Greek, Roman,
                Mesopotamian, and Chinese religious literature too. 'Existence' of life was a
                topic that kept me thinking for years.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>So when I received my
                Self-realization in Sahaja Yoga, everything changed for the better because I
                learnt about spirituality, which is a direct path towards God, and&nbsp;<span
                style='font-weight:bold'>Sahaja Yoga</span>&nbsp;is an amalgamation of all the
                great learnings on this earth, not to forget mentioning that it is most
                scientific. We experience the Shri Param Chaitanya, the energy that creates
                all, is all-encompassing, and is the Shri Ganesh Tatva to which we pray ( in
                temples or mosques or churches or elsewhere) on our central nervous system.
                This energy is the&nbsp;<span style='font-weight:bold'>Truth, pure Love&nbsp;</span>and<span
                style='font-weight:bold'>&nbsp;innocence</span>, and is all-pervading.</p>
