                don't interest me, perhaps because I don't care for change. However, at times,
                when I see some association with me and mine, I might have an opinion; And to
                my relationship with politics, that's the change.</p>

                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>I remember being a 5 or
                6 year old asking my mother why'd the electricity go off for days. It would
                feel like Diwali when we'd finally have it back.&nbsp;</p>

                shedding, kya hi tha', does that even make sense. It didn't, but kya krte it
                was Lalu Prasad Yadav ka Gunda Raj.&nbsp;That's how it was, when Bihar alone
                existed.</p>

                than ever that Jharkhand separated from the once anciently glorious Bihar.
                Jharkhand isn't perfect but at least it's not a frog in the boiling pot of
                criminality yet, unlike what's to be of Bihar. &nbsp;</p>

                position, becoming the 1st among equals.&nbsp;</p>

                Yadav's audacious declaration that his Chief Minister's oath will take place

                move backwards 15-20 years while your uneducated solicitors bask in your

                decades back. Moving out of your home after sundown will certainly be a threat
