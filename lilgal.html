            <img class="code" src="/img/lilgal.jfif" alt="">
            <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>She sat tucked into her
                bed right beside her window gasping in pain, as she looked outside towards the
                street. She tried to breathe, but all she felt was fear. A fear, of not knowing
                what lay ahead and of being choked.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>Tear droplets
                smouldered her face, they seemed to have united with the frequency of the rain
                pouring outside. Her eyes just wouldn't stop. She felt her throat being sore
                inside as she tried curbing her hysterical sobs.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&quot;What did I do
                wrong! Why does it hurt so much!&quot; She wept to herself.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>Art was her passion,
                everything in nature would once inspire her, but now art felt fake. She had
                found work as a designer and had worked in this metropolis for two years now.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>After everything she
                had given, she had earned only&nbsp;suffocation and sufferings.&nbsp;<span
                style='font-weight:bold'>She witnessed, every bit of her art and talent
                scrapped for the sake of a ton of dilapidated egos</span>. She respectfully had
                waged war against the very nature of modern men, which is characterized by a
                lack of empathy and compassion.&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>Her spirit had a life
                force, too strong to give up. Although, she physically could keep up no more.
                She stood in between fighting a losing battle, one where she alone was her
                brigade. While weeping she wished how something would change. She had loved monsoon
                as a kid but now it reminded her of all that she had lost ever since she had
                left her old life.&nbsp;The cosy bed she was in gave her no joy because she
                knew the comfort would not last, she'd have to leave soon and run the hamster
                wheel again.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>She leaned into the
                beautiful memories of her childhood which were her place of solace. The sobbing
                stopped and so did the pain. She didn't feel alone anymore. Getting out of the
                bed she hastily grabbed her diary and a pencil that had been sitting nearby on
                her study table. She opened her journal and scribbled fanatically.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'><span style='font-weight:
                bold'>She had dreamt of climbing mountains, swimming in the ocean</span>&nbsp;and
                so much more. She once deeply believed that she was fated to be lead by her
                passion. Passion for nature and for her art. She had suddenly realised why she
                felt lost. It was because she no longer experienced the love she once had for
                creation.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>

                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>She wrote these words,
                repeatedly till the entire page and an additional three pages were full.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>

                style='font-weight:bold'>Children never give up, their spirits are stronger
                than the rock of Gibraltar and their innocence shines like the brightest of
                suns, radiating exuberance. The faith that they are protected gives them their
                freedom. That spirit is what I want.</span>&quot; She murmured.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>She knew that she would

                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>She reminded herself of
