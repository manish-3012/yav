            <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;It was a bright
                day, Param Singh the village head, sat in the veranda flipping through
                petitions and letters sent by the villagers. Param Singh’s wife had pass
                d away
                twelve years ago, leaving him with three beautiful little daughters, the eldest
                of whom was Maya. Maya had just entered the house, she went to meet her father
                with a pleasing smile. Maya had just returned from school, where she taught
                young girls to read and write. Her beaming smile conveying her delight on
                meeting her father.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>Maya was twentyâ�
                thre
                years old. She was followed to the veranda by her youngest sister, Meenu, who
                on hearing her elder sister’s voice came running out. “Maya didi, it
                els
                awful staying at home all the time, when will I go to school, Baba, when do u think
                I might recover from this annoying cold?” asked Meenu. Maya kept smiling
                at her
                younger sister’s innocence, Param Singh replied, ”Meenu dear, be pat
                t, you
                will soon be alright, so till then rest”. Meenu smiled and quickly sat n
                xt to
                her father and sister.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>A few moments later,
                the second of Param Singh’s daughters entered, with tea and snacks, for 
                er
                father and sisters, she was eighteen years of age, she had been named Meera, by
                her grandmother, after the great Indian saint.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>“There you are
                 my dear
                Meera”, said a happy Param Singh,” I want to read out this letter to
                u all,
                it is regarding the river dam, I received it this very morning, think about it
                and let me know your opinion on how to help these people. “yes Baba!�
                said the
                three girls at once. As Param Singh read the letter, the girls paid utmost
                attention and followed silently. Meera was the first to suggest her Baba an
                idea, which turned out to be a well thought one.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>“I’ll leav
                ow, have
                to return home, Lalan Ji should be on his way, I’ll go and get things re
                dy for
                him”, saying so Maya stood up, touched her father’s feet and started
                 leave
                for her house. She had to welcome her husband, “come soon Maya didi”
                th sisters
                cried out,” I will” said Maya smiling. Param Singh blessed Maya, aft
                which
                she left.</p>

                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>Maya was married to the
                village postmaster Lalan Singh and had been happily married for the past two
                years.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>Meera had passed her
                intermediate with a first-class and wished to continue her studies further. She
                wanted to go to college, but her village had none, so she would have to leave
                for the city. Her father, the village head was a person with progressive ideologies,
                yet in her case, he was too concerned to let her go out, and survive alone.
                Although after many a persuasion by the sisters, Param Singh was finally
                convinced that Meera could handle things well.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>Meera was a bright
                girl, she had lots of dreams and goals to achieve. She wanted to study, so
                much, that she could open a college at her village. She loved her home very
                much and felt the pain of leaving it, she knew there were others who wished to
                study further, but because the way to do that would be to leave their home,
                they would decide otherwise.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>Meera was a very
                beautiful girl, she was not only intelligent but quick-witted as well, loved by
                all, her only flaw was she was adventurous and inquisitive, like a child. As a
                little girl, she would play in the forest and swim through the river only to see
                what lay ahead. Although she had grown up and tamed her wildness her inner
                spirit could never be tamed. she was a good person but objects like swords and
                guns would always excite her. Often as a child she would dress up as the Queen
                of Jhansi and fight the boys playing football or cricket in the fields, she
                would return with black eyes at times, but she would always win.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>Meera had beautiful
                thick, long and dark hair, and her face was round and bright. Her big eyes were
                her most striking feature, and her smile would make everyone around happy.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>Soon came the day when
                she would go and explore new lands, and fulfil her dreams. The entire village
                had come to see her off at the station, her father pulling back his tears, yet
                full of pride for his daughter and so was the entire village. Everyone blessed
                her and wished her happiness. Lalan Singh and Maya were dropping her to the
                college, thus accompanying her, Meera had never stepped out of the village
                before.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>The train had gone
                halfway and Meera was restless by then,” when will we reach the city May
                 didi,
                when will we reach Jijaji?” said Meera,” we’ll reach soon, don
                rry child�
                said Lalan Singh patiently, Maya smiled at her.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>The train suddenly
                stopped, and someone shouted for help, Meera couldn’t stop herself, she 
                uickly
                got up and ran behind the voice. Both Lalan Singh and Maya were shocked.�
                 No,
                wait Meera, wait!” shouted Lalan Singh and Maya. Lalan Singh ran after h
                r.</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <p style=' font-family:Lora;font-size:12pt'>Not far a striking
                sound was heard, Meera was at the end of her trail, the voice was of a man who
                was bleeding terribly, he had been shot in the stomach. Then another similar
                sound was heard, “Meera! Meera! where are you?” she heard Lalan Sing
                alling, but
                she couldn’t reply, something had stung her in the shoulder, the pain w
                tremendous, she fell on the floor. The train started moving
                again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
